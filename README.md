## Overview

This project is a Unity simulation that demonstrates self-driving cars controlled by a neural network trained using a genetic algorithm. The objective is for the cars to learn to navigate a track autonomously, avoiding obstacles and optimizing their performance over generations.

## Features

- **Neural Networks:** Each car is controlled by a neural network that makes decisions based on inputs from the environment.
- **Genetic Algorithm:** The neural networks are evolved over time using a genetic algorithm, improving their performance on the track.
- **Dynamic Obstacles:** The environment includes various obstacles that the cars must navigate around.
- **Visualization:** Real-time visualization of the training process, including the cars' paths and fitness scores.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Easily tweak the genetic algorithm parameters such as mutation rate, crossover rate, and population size.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/quelstriless/ML-car.git
